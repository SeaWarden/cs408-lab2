# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
## Running

In order to run the website itself, you can open the folder location once it is installed on your device and select either of the html files. This will open up a new session in your default browser. If you make any changes to the code, you will need to refresh the browser (live preview will refresh whenever a change is detected).
